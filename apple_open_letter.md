# An Open Letter to Tim Cook: Science is Open, Otherwise It's Just a Story

**Unlocking the Full Potential of Apple's Groundbreaking Health Research Through Open Science**

Dear Tim,

The September 9th unveiling of iPhone 17, Apple Watch 11, and AirPods Pro 3 showcased something truly remarkable: health innovations powered by data from over 250,000 participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study. The ability to predict hypertension, generate sleep scores, and record heart rate through AirPods represents a quantum leap in consumer health technology. As someone who has dedicated their career to advancing science through open data sharing, I write to you with both profound admiration and an exciting opportunity.

## The Power of What You've Built

The Apple Heart and Movement Study stands as one of the most comprehensive longitudinal health datasets ever assembled. With participants spanning all 50 states, ranging from 18 to 90 years of age, and representing diverse health experiences across 15 iPhone and 13 Apple Watch models, this dataset is unprecedented in scale and richness. The real-world impact is undeniable—Apple Watch detecting falls, identifying atrial fibrillation, and potentially saving lives represents technology at its most meaningful.

Your team's achievements in translating this massive dataset into actionable health insights exemplify Apple's commitment to improving human life through innovation. The recent breakthroughs in cardiovascular prediction and sleep analysis demonstrate what's possible when cutting-edge technology meets rigorous scientific methodology.

## Imagine What's Possible Together

As a researcher who has contributed the largest publicly available EEG behavioral dataset (HBN-EEG)—now the foundation for the largest NeurIPS challenge in neuroscience—I've witnessed firsthand how open science accelerates discovery. When we released our multimodal dataset, it didn't just advance our own research; it sparked innovations from researchers worldwide, pushing both machine learning and neuroscience forward at an unprecedented pace.

The principle is simple yet powerful: **Science is open, otherwise it's just a story.**

Your Apple Heart and Movement Study data, if made openly available, could catalyze a global research revolution. Imagine thousands of the world's brightest minds—from Stanford to MIT, from DeepMind to academic labs worldwide—competing and collaborating to extract insights from your dataset. The collective intelligence of the global scientific community, armed with this unprecedented resource, could accelerate health discoveries by decades.

## A Collaborative Path Forward

The infrastructure for responsible open science already exists and is ready to support Apple's data sharing:

- **BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)**: Standardized formats for neuroimaging and physiological data
- **NEMAR.org**: Robust platforms for large-scale data sharing and analysis
- **HEDtags.org**: Sophisticated annotation systems for behavioral and physiological data

Our community has solved the technical challenges of responsible data sharing while maintaining participant privacy through de-identification and secure access protocols. We're not asking Apple to reinvent the wheel—we're offering to provide the wheels.

## The Apple Way of Open Science

This initiative aligns perfectly with Apple's core values. Just as Apple democratized computing, music, and mobile technology, opening the Heart and Movement Study data could democratize health research. It's innovation through collaboration, privacy through design, and impact through openness.

Consider the ripple effects:
- **Accelerated Discovery**: Global researchers competing to build better health prediction models
- **Enhanced Diversity**: International perspectives bringing varied approaches to health challenges  
- **Validation and Reproducibility**: Independent verification strengthening Apple's scientific credibility
- **Educational Impact**: Training the next generation of health tech innovators
- **Societal Benefit**: Insights that could improve health outcomes for billions globally

## The Time is Now

Apple employees across LinkedIn are sharing their pride in contributing to these groundbreaking health models and data collection efforts. That pride is well-deserved—but imagine amplifying that impact a thousandfold. Every researcher who gains new insights, every student who learns from the data, every patient whose life improves because of discoveries made possible by this open dataset would be a testament to Apple's vision of technology serving humanity.

The September 9th announcements showed us what Apple can achieve with this data. An open approach could show us what humanity can achieve.

**Science thrives in the open. Innovation accelerates through collaboration. Impact multiplies when knowledge is shared.**

Tim, you have the opportunity to not just change health technology, but to change how health research is conducted globally. The Apple Heart and Movement Study could become more than groundbreaking research—it could become the foundation upon which countless other breakthroughs are built.

The global scientific community stands ready to help. All that's needed is the courage to let science be open.
