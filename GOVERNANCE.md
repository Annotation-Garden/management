# Annotation Garden Governance

## Mission

The Annotation Garden Initiative (AGI) establishes an open infrastructure for collaborative, multi-layered annotation of stimuli used in neuroscience research.

## Organizational Structure

### Core Team

The core team provides strategic direction and maintains AGI infrastructure:
- Project coordination
- Repository maintenance
- Standards integration
- Community engagement

### Working Groups

Specialized working groups focus on specific domains:
- **Static Images Working Group**: NSD and similar datasets
- **Video/Temporal Working Group**: Movie stimuli and temporal annotations
- **Tools Development Working Group**: Web interfaces and automation
- **Standards Working Group**: BIDS and HED integration

### Contributors

All contributors are valued members of the AGI community. Contributions include:
- Adding or refining annotations
- Code contributions to tools
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and feature requests
- Community support

## Decision Making

### Repository-Level Decisions

Individual repositories maintain autonomy for:
- Annotation schema within that stimulus
- Tool-specific features
- Documentation structure

Decisions are made through:
1. Discussion in Issues
2. Consensus among active contributors
3. Core team guidance when needed

### Organization-Level Decisions

Cross-repository decisions affecting AGI as a whole:
- New repository creation
- Standards adoption
- Infrastructure changes
- Policy updates

Process:
1. Proposal through Issue in management repository
2. Community discussion period (minimum 1 week)
3. Core team decision based on consensus and mission alignment

## Quality Standards

### Annotation Quality

- Inter-annotator agreement metrics when applicable
- HED validation passes
- Documentation of annotation methodology
- Version control with clear change descriptions

### Code Quality

- Tests for new features
- Documentation for public APIs
- Code review by at least one other contributor
- Adherence to repository-specific style guides

## Conflict Resolution

1. Discussion in relevant Issue or PR
2. Involve working group if applicable
3. Core team mediation if needed
4. Focus on scientific merit and mission alignment

## Amendments

This governance document can be updated through the organization-level decision process described above.
